All my notes I found out when using Orbit
-----------------------------------------

1. Each table must have a field id.

2. if you're trying to inject fields from table A in results based on table B, table B should contain a A_id field.

3. Find_all and find_first can be passed a table to fill in values for ? . Only works with an array (no holes).
	For example: book:find_all("id = ? ",{{1,3}}) returns { book1, book3 }
	This however does not work for :find()

4.  orbit.htmlify(app, "layout", "_.+", "render_.+") is a really necessary function for render_* functions to work.
