All my notes I found out when using Orbit
-----------------------------------------

1. Each table must have a field id.

2. if you're trying to inject fields from table A in results based on table B, table B should contain a A_id field.

3. Find_all and find_first can be passed a table to fill in values for ? . Only works with an array (no holes).
	For example: book:find_all("id = ? ",{{1,3}}) returns { book1, book3 }
	This however does not work for :find()
	Further: be ware of empty tables! It'll bork.

4.  orbit.htmlify(app, "layout", "_.+", "render_.+") is a really necessary function for render_* functions to work.

5. Upon getting an error like this one:
	There was an error in the specified application. The full error message follows:

	...jpjacobs/.luarocks/share/lua/5.1//wsapi/response.lua:12: bad argument #1 to 'concat' (table expected, got nil)
	stack traceback:

	Check whether your controller returns something.

6. fields name, model, meta of a model are used internally, do not overwrite.

7. would be usefull to have a function which will contain the next id to be assigned for a model (in order to avoid creating instances in GET calls).
	In the mean time, use (conn:execute[[SELECT seq FROM sqlite_sequence WHERE name = ]]..model.table_prefix..model.name):fetch()+1

8. Don't try passing non-strings into the htmlify functions, it won't work. (resulting in this error: bad argument #1 to 'pairs' (table expected, got number))
	tostring() them first.
